This is a depth-range-diophantine CSL parser/matcher/enumerator, an original algorithm. The overall time complexity is polynomial.

Planned Refactor Changes:
The current approach generates a lot of equations and handles alternations in a way that makes backrefs difficult to deal with. The new algorithm will generate equations differently. Alternations will not "branch" equations anymore, instead, the terms of each alternation in a chain will be summed with binary factors that sum to 1, e.g. "(a|bc+|def)\1" -> (b0(1) + b1(1+x0) + b2(3)) + (b0(1) + b1(1+x0) + b2(3)), b0+b1+b2=1. This means there is no longer a need for multiple independent equations per expr, nor for a cartesian product operation. Instead there will be one main equation generated, along with simple auxiliary equations for the binary toggle vars "bvars" to sum to 1, that form a system.

u/sepp2k from Reddit pointed out that the candidate solution enumeration is exponential, but this can be fixed: the solver will generate solution candidates using a knapsack-style bounded subset-sum dynamic programming approach.

Summary:
Generate a parse tree from the expression where groups nest. Generate equation fragments bottom-up, where
  leaf => add group size constant
  repetitions => multiply by free variable
  concatention => cartesian product of pair sums
  alternation => merge equation list

The resulting equations are a sum of products, and are rewritten as linear diophantine equations. Then for some match input, solve each rewritten equation in the root level equation list set equal to the input size using a linear diophantine equation solver. The general solution is then constrained using integer programming, with the trivial starting bounds 0 <= y[i] <= L/c[i], where y[i] is a free variable in the rewrite, c[i] is its constant factor, and L is the input size. Then use a k-factors factorization of each y[i] to generate solutions in terms of the original free variables before the rewrite, which we call x[i].

These x[i] solutions are plugged back into the parse tree to perform matching recursively.

With this set up, equations can be solved and matched in parallel, and during matching, a group's children can be matched in parallel.

Time Complexity Discussion:
Linear diophantine equation solving, integer programming min/max'ing, and k-factors factorization are known polynomial time algorithms. During equation generation, each alternation => merge creates n + m equations, each concatenation => cartesian product of pair sums creates n^2 equations, and the composition of these operations is polynomial.
